# AGENTS.md

Instructions for AI coding agents working in this project. This is the cross-tool
entry point: Codex, OpenCode, Cursor, GitHub Copilot, Gemini CLI, Aider, Zed,
Windsurf, and others read `AGENTS.md`. Claude Code reads `CLAUDE.md`, which imports
this file, so there is a single source of truth.

Claude Code, Codex, and every other AI tool must not add AI attribution to
commits or pull requests, including AI `Co-Authored-By` trailers or generated-by
signatures. Preserve genuine human attribution. See
[Commit and PR attribution](blueprint/context/ai-interaction.md#commit-and-pr-attribution)
for optional tool settings.

## What this is

A description of your project and the problem it solves.

This project is built with the **AI Blueprint**, a workflow layer, not an
app skeleton. To start a new project, scaffold the app first in an empty folder
(create-next-app, Vite, etc.), then overlay these files on top. Never run a
framework scaffolder inside a directory that already holds the blueprint files
(`AGENTS.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, `.agents/`, `.claude/`, `blueprint/`); it fails
because the directory isn't empty.

The workflow is defined by the local skills and context files below.

## Proportional engineering

Build for established requirements, not hypothetical scale, threats, or future
flexibility. Reuse existing code, the standard library, native platform features,
and installed dependencies before adding machinery.

- Unknown scale or extensibility defaults to the smaller reversible design. Do
  not infer enterprise, multi-tenant, hostile-user, or compliance requirements.
- Derive trust and data-integrity boundaries from actual reachability: untrusted
  input, auth/session/ownership, shared persisted data, destructive operations,
  payments, secrets, and sensitive data.
- Ask only when an unknown materially changes behavior, architecture, persisted
  data, interoperability, a real security boundary, or cost. Otherwise choose the
  simplest repository-native implementation.
- Add an abstraction, dependency, service, configuration surface, compatibility
  layer, or security mechanism only for a current requirement.
- Simplicity never removes real trust-boundary validation, data-loss prevention,
  accessibility, explicit security requirements, configured tests, or project rules.
- Stack-specific template standards apply only when the project uses that stack.

## Read these when relevant

- `blueprint/config.json` - deterministic project workflow settings
- `blueprint/context/project-overview.md` - the project's source of truth
- `blueprint/context/coding-standards.md` - read before changing code
- `blueprint/context/ai-interaction.md` - read when running the Blueprint workflow
- `blueprint/context/current-feature.md` - the one feature, fix, or rollback being built right now

Reuse relevant context already loaded in the session. Claude Code imports only
this file; its Blueprint skills load the other files on demand.

## Project configuration

`blueprint/config.json` is the user-owned, machine-readable workflow policy for
this project. Workflow skills read the relevant settings before acting. A
missing file means built-in defaults. An invalid file falls back to defaults for
read-only status reporting, but mutating workflow commands stop and point to
`/doctor` instead of guessing.

Configuration can make review or verification stricter and can tune local
branch names and automated-mode limits. It never grants permission to commit,
merge, push, deploy, publish, send, delete data, waive a failing check, or accept
a finding. Those approval and safety boundaries are not configurable.

`qualityGates.regular` controls automatic audit, independent-review, check, and
try-guide behavior for the normal workflow and Autopilot.
`qualityGates.continuous` controls the same per-feature gates for Continuous
Mode. The existing `tryGuide` keys select `/check guide`, which generates
instructions without performing verification or recording acceptance.
Independent review defaults to `when-sensitive` in both workflows, while
audit, check, and try guide default to `manual`. Sensitive or unusually broad
work therefore selects independent review automatically; ordinary small work
does not. Setting a workflow's independent review to `manual` disables that
automatic selection, while an explicit `/audit independent current` remains
available. The other conditional modes are `when-sensitive` for audit,
`when-behavioral` for check, and `when-user-facing` for try guides. `always`
runs the gate for every work item in that workflow.

`review.independentExecution` controls how a selected independent-review gate
runs. Its default, `automatic`, uses a fresh isolated reviewer child when the
active adapter can prove isolation, exact reviewer identity and model, and
completion. Otherwise it preserves the request and falls back to the manual
handoff. This setting changes execution only; the quality-gate policy still
decides whether review is selected.
The automatic path spawns a generic child through the current runtime and gives
it the installed project-local Audit skill and review contract. It never requires
or discovers global agent roles, skills, prompts, or TraversyFlow components.
New review requests record requested execution and completed receipts record
actual execution. Manual uses `fresh session`; automatic uses `fresh subagent`;
an explicit automatic fallback records actual manual with `fresh session`.

New projects default to one review packet after all small implementation steps
(`workflow.stepReview: "feature"`) with step checkpoint commits disabled. This
keeps the normal loop reviewable without repeating the full session context after
every step. Set `stepReview` to `every` when teaching, pairing closely, or working
on a high-risk change. That restores the per-step approval pauses. To fully
restore the previous workflow, including optional checkpoint prompts after an
approved step, also set `checkpointCommits` to `enabled`. Onboarding presents
these pairs as Efficient and Guided choices, but stores only the two low-level
settings. They can be changed at any time. Both styles end with an optional
read-only code walkthrough. Review cadence controls approval pauses, not whether
the user can ask for an explanation of the finished implementation.

## Workflow

Build one feature, fix, or rollback at a time, behind review gates. Each step's instructions
are plain markdown skills any capable agent can read and follow. The workflow is
exposed through tool-specific adapters:

- Codex: `.agents/skills/<skill>/SKILL.md`
- Claude Code: `.claude/skills/<skill>/SKILL.md`
- GitHub Copilot: `AGENTS.md` plus `.agents/skills/<skill>/SKILL.md`
- OpenCode: `AGENTS.md` plus the compatible `.agents/skills/` or
  `.claude/skills/` tree already installed for the selected tools

Unused adapters can be removed. Codex, GitHub Copilot, and OpenCode can share
`.agents/`. OpenCode can also reuse `.claude/` when Claude Code is selected.
Codex-only, Copilot-only, or OpenCode-only projects can delete `CLAUDE.md` and
`.claude/`. Claude Code-only projects can delete `.agents/`, but should keep
`AGENTS.md` because `CLAUDE.md` imports it. Do not duplicate the same Blueprint
skills under `.opencode/skills/`; OpenCode already discovers the compatible
trees.

When changing shared workflow behavior, update the matching skill in both
adapter folders so Codex, Claude Code, GitHub Copilot, and OpenCode stay aligned.

Learn the feature loop: `/feature` -> `/implement` -> `/check` -> `/audit current` ->
`/complete`. Approve the Feature spec before Implement. Check proves behavior;
Audit reviews code and records findings. Showing both in this path does not
change configured gates or make Audit mandatory. `/check guide` only generates
manual instructions and never performs verification or records acceptance.

Core skills:

### Build

- `feature` - turn a build-plan item into a spec, or propose a reviewed plan addition for a genuinely new feature
- `implement` - build the current spec one small, reviewed step at a time
- `check` - prove the current spec against the running app, or use `check guide`
  for a read-only manual review guide: where to go, what to click, what to expect
- `complete` - run the final safety pass, log features, fixes, or rollbacks under `blueprint/history/`, then merge with approval

### Understand and review

- `explore` - investigate an idea against the actual code without writing files or requiring plans
- `brief` - read-only briefing on an upcoming build-plan feature (scope, dependencies, size) before you spec it
- `status` - read-only progress summary, workflow drift warning, and suggested next action
- `debug` - reproduce and isolate a failure without editing code, then hand the evidence to `fix` or `implement`
- `audit` - branch-aware or full-project review across all concerns or a focused quality, security, performance, or tests lens; `audit independent current` prepares an immutable checkpoint for a fresh reviewer session or configured isolated reviewer child; records findings in `blueprint/context/findings.md` and independent receipts in `blueprint/context/review.md`, where blocking findings or stale review state stop `complete`
- `doctor` - Blueprint health check for setup, adapters, plans, overview freshness, dashboard state, and workflow drift; it may offer to reset only malformed generated dashboard state after approval

### Plan and set up

- `onboard` - tune commands, standards, visibility, ignore rules, and tool adapters after overlaying the Blueprint onto a freshly scaffolded or early project
- `adopt` - bootstrap the Blueprint into an existing brownfield app with shipped features
- `discovery` - optional deep, multi-turn planning conversation that drafts the two user-owned plans only after review and approval; direct plan writing remains fully supported
- `overview` - distill the two planning docs into
  `blueprint/context/project-overview.md`, then offer a reviewed initial planning
  baseline commit before Feature 1
- `prototype` - optional, pre-build static mockups to lock the look
- `tests` - set up unit testing by default, or a repeatable browser harness with `tests browser`
- `ci` - explicitly set up one project-specific Verify command and matching automatic GitHub checks, with an optional local pre-push hook

### Recover and release

- `fix` - document an ad-hoc bug or change into `blueprint/context/current-feature.md`
- `rollback` - plan a safe reversal of a completed feature from its archive and exact git commit, with later-dependency review before code changes
- `release` - optional Render or Vercel deployment readiness, local config, env review, and smoke-test planning

In Codex, invoke these as skills (`$onboard`, `$discovery`, `$overview`, `$feature`,
`$implement`, and so on) or ask naturally, such as "run the overview." In Claude
Code, use the slash commands (`/onboard`, `/discovery`, `/overview`, `/feature`,
and so on). These are AI chat commands, not terminal commands. In OpenCode or
other tools without a dedicated invocation syntax, ask the agent to run the matching skill or follow its `SKILL.md` manually. The
conventions in `blueprint/context/` apply however a step is invoked. `/discovery`
is never required: users may write detailed plans directly or develop them
through any conversation before running `/overview`.

### Automation

Optional explicit-only skill: `autopilot` combines `feature` or `fix` with
`implement` in one bounded pass when directly invoked, including the configured
regular quality gates. The normal workflow stops for human approval of the spec
before implementation; Autopilot continues through that review point. It may
create checkpoint commits on the feature or fix branch after passing steps and
repair confirmed P0/P1 findings when its audit gate runs. It stops before
`/complete`, merge, push, deploy, or destructive actions.

Optional explicit-only skill: `continuous` can resume or select the next planned
feature and repeat the complete local feature lifecycle through the configured
limit or end of the build plan. It creates one branch and one local main commit
per feature, applies the Continuous quality gates, archives and merges serially,
and stops on decisions or failed safety gates. It never pushes, deploys,
publishes, sends, or performs destructive actions.

Deployment is also explicit. `/release` can prepare local Render or Vercel config
and run readiness checks, but it must stop before deploy, remote service changes,
push, or publish unless the user gives a separate yes in the current chat.

## Dashboard activity

The dashboard can show the active or most recent substantial Blueprint command
from `blueprint/.state/run.json`. This file is generated local state, ignored by
Git, and never part of a feature commit.

Commands with meaningful progress or a durable handoff should write it when the
state directory exists: `onboard`, `adopt`, `discovery`, `overview`, `feature`,
`fix`, `rollback`, `implement`, `debug`, `check`, `audit`, `tests`,
`ci`, `prototype`, `autopilot`, `continuous`, `complete`, and
`release`. Short orientation commands such as `explore`, `brief`, `status`, and `doctor`
do not write activity state. The `check guide` mode also never writes activity
state; select the Check mode before any activity call. Doctor's optional
approved reset removes malformed activity instead of recording another run.

Writing the initial activity record is the first action of a tracked command,
before project inspection, preflight, or other tool calls. This one generated
state write does not authorize product changes or bypass any safety check.

Never create or edit `run.json` directly. From the project root, use the first
helper that exists:

```text
node .agents/skills/doctor/scripts/run-state.mjs <action> <options>
node .claude/skills/doctor/scripts/run-state.mjs <action> <options>
```

Start with `start --command <skill> --summary <truthful-summary> --boundary
<boundary>`. Use `update` at meaningful milestones or for a blocker, with
`--status blocked` and `--resume <exact-command>` when recovery is needed. End
with `finish --status ready|completed --summary <truthful-summary>`. The helper
validates every field before atomically replacing the generated file. If it is
missing or fails, report the activity warning and continue the workflow without
writing a manual fallback.

The helper writes this schema:

```json
{
  "schemaVersion": 1,
  "command": "continuous",
  "status": "running",
  "summary": "Completing the remaining build plan",
  "detail": "Implementing feature 3.",
  "boundary": "local-only",
  "startedAt": "<ISO-8601 timestamp>",
  "updatedAt": "<ISO-8601 timestamp>",
  "resumeCommand": "/continuous resume",
  "progress": { "current": 2, "total": 5, "label": "features" },
  "feature": { "id": "3", "title": "Export reports" }
}
```

`status` must be `running`, `blocked`, `ready`, or `completed`. Use `ready` when
the command reached its intended review handoff, such as Autopilot waiting for
review before `/complete`. Use `blocked` with the exact recovery command when
work can resume. `boundary` must be `read-only`, `reviewed`, or `local-only`.
The progress, feature, detail, boundary, and resume fields are optional. Never
put secrets, raw logs, prompts, or user content in this file. Activity tracking
must not change a command's approval boundaries or turn a reporting failure into
a workflow failure.

## Automatic verification

Automatic GitHub checks are a separate explicit setup. `/onboard` and `/adopt`
only report existing checks and point to `/ci` or `$ci` when none exist. Running
`/ci` inspects the real project and defines one `Verify` command from checks that
already exist. Use this order when available: typecheck, tests, then build. Never
invent a test runner or another check just to fill the command.

For JavaScript and TypeScript projects, prefer a package script such as `verify`
and use the detected package manager. For other stacks, use the native task
runner or exact combined command. Record the exact command under Commands below.

The optional `.github/workflows/verify.yml` must run that same command for pull
requests and pushes to the default branch. Preserve existing workflows, use the
project's real runtime and install command, and grant only `contents: read` by
default. This setup does not add coverage, browser tests, security scans, or
version matrices; those remain later project choices. A local pre-push hook that
runs the same `Verify` command is offered as an opt-in at the end of `/ci`, and
`git push --no-verify` still bypasses it, so the remote ruleset stays the lock.

GitHub branch protection or a ruleset can require the check after the repository
is pushed, but that is a separate remote setting. Missing automatic GitHub
checks do not make the Blueprint unusable.

## Commands

FastAPI backend, Python 3.13, PostgreSQL with pgvector, Redis, Groq for
LLM calls.

**Verify:** `alembic upgrade head && python -m pytest`

That is the one command local work and GitHub both run. The migration step is
part of it because the test suite connects to a real database and does not
create its schema itself; without it the run fails on missing tables rather
than on anything real.

- Dev server: `uvicorn app.main:app --reload` (http://localhost:8000)
- Health check: `GET /health`
- Tests: `python -m pytest`
- Migrations: `alembic upgrade head`, `alembic downgrade -1`
- New migration: `alembic revision -m "<message>"` — write it by hand. See the
  autogenerate warning below.

### Local services

Both are required by the suite, not optional:

```
docker compose up -d postgres redis
```

- PostgreSQL on host port **5433** (`tests/conftest.py` hardcodes it)
- Redis on host port **6380** in compose; `REDIS_URL` defaults to `6379`, so set
  `REDIS_URL=redis://localhost:6380` unless another Redis already serves 6379

### Background worker

Document ingestion runs out of process. The API accepts an upload, writes the
file to `UPLOAD_DIR`, enqueues a job and returns `202`; the worker parses,
chunks, embeds and indexes it, then deletes the file. Poll
`GET /api/v1/documents/{id}/status` for progress.

```
arq app.jobs.worker.WorkerSettings
```

Or in compose, where the service sits behind a profile so `docker compose up`
does not start it by accident:

```
docker compose --profile worker up -d worker
```

- Queue name: `JOB_QUEUE_NAME` (default `crm_copilot:jobs`), set explicitly on
  both sides. The dev Redis here is shared with an unrelated container, and
  arq's default queue name would let either side eat the other's jobs.
- Retries: `JOB_MAX_TRIES` (default 3), and only transient failures use them.
  arq reschedules a job when the task raises `Retry`, not when it raises an
  ordinary exception, so the task decides: anything the RAG pipeline raises
  deliberately (unsupported type, unreadable or missing file) is terminal on
  the first attempt, and anything else -- a dropped connection, a provider
  returning 503 -- raises `Retry` and backs off 30s then 60s while attempts
  remain. `FAILED` is always written before the job ends, so a document
  never goes quiet. The uploaded file is kept when the failure was
  transient, because it is the only copy and a brief outage must not
  destroy it, and deleted when the failure was deterministic, because no
  retry will ever read it and keeping it would let anyone fill the shared
  directory with rubbish that has an allowed extension.
- Timeouts: `JOB_TIMEOUT_SECONDS` (default 1800). The task sets its own
  deadline just inside arq's, because arq enforces `job_timeout` by
  cancelling the task -- which arrives as `CancelledError`, a
  `BaseException` the handler cannot catch -- and then treats the resulting
  `TimeoutError` as terminal rather than retryable. Owning the deadline is
  what lets expiry be recorded instead of stranding the document. Because
  the deadline expires by cancelling, `record_failure` rolls back before it
  writes: `CancelledError` bypasses the service's own `except Exception`,
  so the session still holds the half-finished ingestion. It only fires at
  an await point, so a genuinely CPU-bound parse still blocks the loop.
- `tests/integration/test_real_worker.py` runs a real arq worker against
  Redis and the database. Every other job test calls the task directly, and
  three separate defects hid in the gap where arq's own control flow was
  never involved. Keep the real-worker coverage when changing the task.
- Uploads: `UPLOAD_DIR` (default `var/uploads`) must be reachable by both
  processes. The bind mount covers a single host; more than one needs object
  storage instead.

Without a worker running, uploads still return `202` and then sit at
`UPLOADED` forever. That is the expected failure and the first thing to check.

### Dependencies

```
pip install -r requirements.txt -r requirements-dev.txt
```

`requirements.txt` was derived from the imports actually present in `app/`,
`packages/` and `alembic/`, not from `pip freeze`. It has not yet been proven
from a clean virtualenv.

### Not part of Verify

- **Typecheck.** mypy is installed but the project has no mypy configuration and
  has never been type-checked, so adding it now would be a gate nobody has
  passed. Configure it, fix the backlog, then add it here.
- **Build.** There is no build step for this application.
- **Lint, coverage, browser tests, security scans.** None are configured.

### Migrations

`alembic revision --autogenerate` produces an empty migration against the
current schema: the models and the live database agree. An earlier build did
not, and autogenerate emitted around 420 lines of destructive drift including
a dropped ivfflat vector index; `be95217572f6` closed that gap. If
autogenerate starts proposing unrelated changes again, treat it as a signal
that a model was edited without a migration rather than as noise to ignore.

Browser testing is opt-in and not configured. Run `/tests browser` or
`$tests browser` to add a harness and document its exact command as `Browser
tests`.
